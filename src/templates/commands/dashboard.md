## Description
Generates a self-contained static HTML dashboard that visualizes the current state of your STDD project. No external CSS or JS dependencies required. The dashboard includes:

- **Overview**: Active, verified, and archived change counts with status cards
- **Quality Score**: Circular progress indicator combining complexity and certainty scores
- **Progress Timeline**: Last 20 entries from progress.jsonl with status indicators
- **Constitution Status**: Article list with pass/fail/waived badges and health percentage
- **Evidence Gallery**: Scanned evidence files from all change directories
