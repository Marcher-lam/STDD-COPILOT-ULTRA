# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to STDD Copilot will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- **Skill Graph Engine**: Dynamic DAG orchestration with intent-adaptive topology (hotfix/feature/repair/research)

- **Constitution System**: 9 articles with Hook Enforcement and waiver tracking
- **Ralph Loop TDD**: Red → Green → Refactor cycle with phase enforcement
- **5-Level Defense System**: Human confirmation gates, micro-task isolation, failure rollback, static quality, mutation review
- **Graph Runtime Modules**: Dynamic router, executor with self-healing, evidence capture, error propagator, heterogeneous adapter, parallel executor
- **Multi-Agent Runtime**: Party Mode state machine, SudoLang parser/executor
- **Browser Automation**: Built-in Playwright integration for E2E testing
- **Workspace/Monorepo Support**: Registry, scope detection, per-package commands
- **Mutation Testing**: Quick heuristic mode + Stryker delegation
- **Evidence Capture**: Structured error evidence with multi-hop propagation
- **22 AI Engine Adapters**: 4-Tier compatibility system
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow validation

### Changed

- **graph-executor.js**: Restored noop fallback with `shouldFailOn` simulation support
- **CI/CD**: Added Node.js 18/20/22 matrix testing

### Fixed
- Graph executor self-healing now preserves `_healingMeta` during rollback
- Integration tests aligned with actual CLI error messages
- `new change` now creates valid tasks.md with sample tasks

### Security
- Path traversal protection in change name validation
- Directory traversal prevention in file operations
- Command injection prevention via `spawnSync`
- No hardcoded credentials or secrets

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-13
